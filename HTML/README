The Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 were compiled together to this one file called Lesson_1.
So it should be "missing" Lesson 2 from the files here. 
In Dave's Course those lessons had different folders for eachother, but
there is no point on doing it just to separate the "main.css" from the 
"index.html" file.
